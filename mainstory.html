                            <p>
                                Now you may not have heard of Ahau Tulum Sculpture Park but I guarantee you’ve seen it’s main attraction! The new park which opened in 2021 is home to Ven A La Luz, the giant wooden sculpture which fast become an Instagram staple in the area. Until recently, the sculpture was available for free to the public, serving as the entrance to the Ahau Hotel, but the disruption photographers caused to traffic led the hotel to develop Ahau Tulum Sculpture Park, with the structure forming the park’s centrepiece.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ahau Tulum Scultpure Park is a new art installation in Tulum Beach. Based at the Ahau Hotel, the Sculpture Park is home to the iconic Ven A La Luz sculpture, one of Tulum’s most instagram famous location. There are also several other art works to see at the park.

                                The sculpture park is part of the Ahau Hotel in Tulum Beach. The gate to the park can be found nestled in between some shops to the left of the hotel entrance. It can be quite hard to find if you go before it opens, especially if, like me, you thought it was still located on the street! The high fence walls are deceiving but you’ll find a small sign with a picture of the sculpture indicating the entrance, or you’ll see a queue of people forming in the street.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There’s a queueing system in place which allows everyone to get their perfect photo without anyone else! The only problem with this is that each person is limited to 1 minute in front of the sculpture, so make sure you know what you want and how to get it! As soon as you buys your ticket, you’ll automatically join the photo queue. You can’t miss it!

                                Ven A La Luz is located in the Beach region of Tulum so if you’re staying at one of the many beach hotels, you can easily walk there. If you’re staying in the Puebla, it’s around a 45 minute cycle down to the beach or a $20 taxi each way. There are plenty of great restaurants, beach clubs and cafes at the beach so it’s definitely worth visiting the area anyway!

                        <p>
                            The days of the dead are truly a celebration of life.  When children dance with caricatures of death, eat skull sugar molds and learn to respect that life is brief, they learn there is a circle to life and to not fear death and then are free to enjoy and appreciate every moment.

                            While the primary focus of our holidays to Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula is very much on touring and exploring, many of our clients will want to end (or begin) their stay with a few days relaxation at the beach. Before going into any detail about individual beaches, let’s start with some broad-based information about the region.

                            A breakout star in “Roma,” first-time actress Yalitza Aparicio went from small-town schoolteacher-in-training to snagging a lead role in director Alfonso Cuarón’s autobiographical movie about his formative years in Mexico.

                            Mexican traditional folk dance is a representation of its different cultural traditions and, with them, the history of Mexico. Its historical roots combine indigenous, European, and African cultural influences that are represented in each performance.
