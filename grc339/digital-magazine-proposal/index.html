            <p>For my proposal I want to use my magazine that I already made in the GrC 440 class, which is a travel magazine focused on Mexico. The intention of this magazine is to show the Mexican culture through its most emblematic places, magic towns, as well as its typical foods of each region of the country and its traditions.. </p><!--Short description of the magazine-->
