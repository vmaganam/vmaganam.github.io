                         <p>Frida Kahlo is unquestionably Mexico's best-known modern painter. Much of her fame is doubtlessly due to the way in which the contemporary world has viewed the unique manner in which she built her public persona; but it wasn't always like this. During her lifetime, her work was eclipsed by the monumental figure of her husband, Diego Rivera, who was the country's most acclaimed artist at that period.

                         <p>Mexican traditional folk dance is a representation of its different cultural traditions and, with them, the history of Mexico. Its historical roots combine indigenous, European, and African cultural influences that are represented in each performance. While dance has been an important part of our country's pre-Hispanic history, most of the original elements of these dances have been lost, either by Catholic evangelization or by modernization, with only a few forms of dance that survive almost intact.
